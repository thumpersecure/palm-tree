Rand network traffic 
want you to create a script in bash for Kali Linux OS that generates a lot of random network traffic (for a project of mine) using  a mix of the following:
	1.	randomized session timing,
	2.	randomizing user agents,
	3.	random MAC addresses for devices,
	4.	random well known dns servers,
	5.	spoof op systems,
	6.	use lifestyle news, world news, technology news, health news, and trending topics at random ,
	7.	echo locally some local traffic udp
	8.	one option for outbound to just the different various news domains, or to a specific ip & port (so I can easily connect to my VPS).
	9.	second option to output the news headlines it picks up from the tops news sites categories I suggested.
	10.	it should have a 3rd option included you pick to make it work best for randomizing identities.
The idea is to make advertisers and data collectors possibly unable to truly use my data with this script running. It’s for a test project.
