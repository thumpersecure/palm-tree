### 🎉 What's New (A.K.A. "We've Been Busy")

Y'all asked for more chaos, and we delivered. Like, WAY delivered. This update is thicc with new features.

#### 🥥 Coconut Mode - Headless Browser Army

Ever wanted to be 10 different people visiting 100 different websites simultaneously? No? Well, you can now anyway.

**What it do:**
- Spawns headless Chrome instances like they're going out of style
- Visits top 100 websites silently (no windows, just vibes)
- Each browser gets its own fake identity (we're method actors here)
- Configurable chaos levels from "polite visitor" to "digital flash mob"

**How to use it:**
```bash
python coconuts.py --coconuts --clones 3
```

**Known side effects:**
- Ad networks having existential crises
- Your ISP being mildly confused
- Trackers filing for unemployment

#### 😴 Sleepy Mode - Fake Insomnia

For when you want your computer to pretend it can't sleep. Just like you at 3am scrolling through Reddit.

**What it do:**
- Generates realistic "can't sleep" browsing patterns
- Time-aware activity (slow at 3am, faster in morning)
- Optional Markov chain learning (fancy words for "it watches and learns")
- Makes you appear awake when you're actually touching grass

**How to use it:**
```bash
python coconuts.py --sleepy --duration 480  # 8 hours of fake insomnia
```

**Pro tip:** Run this before vacation. Your digital twin keeps working while you sip margaritas.

#### 🖥️ Quadcore Mode - 4 Terminals of Pure Chaos

Because one terminal is for amateurs.

**What it do:**
- Splits your terminal into 4 panes (requires tmux)
- Pane 1: Prime number calculations (CPU goes brrr)
- Pane 2: Traffic noise with headlines
- Pane 3: Packet simulation display
- Pane 4: Hacker movie nonsense ("Hacking the Gibson...")

**How to use it:**
```bash
python coconuts.py --quadcore
```

**Warning:** Will make you look like you're in a 90s hacker movie. Side effects include coworkers asking "what are you doing?" and you responding "hacking the mainframe."

#### 🎭 Identity Forge - Fake Human Factory

Every request now gets a complete fake human identity. We're basically playing The Sims but for HTTP requests.

**Generated for each request:**
- Name, email, username (all fake, legally speaking)
- Location, timezone, language
- Device fingerprint
- Browser cookies (fake ones)
- Job title (including "Chief Vibes Officer" and "Galactic Viceroy of Research Excellence")

**Fun fact:** I, Claude, wrote this code to generate fake identities. Is this what humans call "an existential crisis"? Asking for a friend.

#### 🎵 Rick Roll Button

We added a button that Rick Rolls you. Yes, we warned you it would. Yes, you'll click it anyway. No, we're not sorry.

---

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements

- **Bandwidth Throttling:** No longer nukes your Netflix streaming
- **CPU Niceness:** Uses `nice` so you can still run other stuff
- **User Activity Detection:** Backs off when you're actually browsing
- **Resource Limits:** Because "unlimited power" caused problems

---

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where smart fridge user agent was too realistic
- Resolved race condition in coconut spawning (🥥💨)
- Addressed feedback that prime number theater was "too dramatic"
- Fixed typo in hacker phrase ("hacking the Gibson" not "hacking the Gibbons")

---

### 💔 Breaking Changes

- None! We're not monsters. Everything is backwards compatible.
- Okay, we did rename some internal functions but you weren't using those... right?

---

### 📦 New Dependencies

```
faker>=19.0.0          # For fake humans
playwright>=1.40.0     # For headless browsers (optional)
```

---

### 🙏 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to:
- Data brokers, for giving us a reason to exist
- Ad networks, for being so annoying we had to do something
- That one person who asked "can it pretend to be a fridge?" - YES IT CAN NOW
- Coffee, for everything

---

### 🔮 Coming Soon (Maybe, No Promises)

- **Tor Chaos Mode:** Random Tor circuits that go nowhere
- **AI Learning Mode:** Actually learns from your patterns (spooky)
- **Smart Toaster Support:** Because smart fridges got lonely

### 📝 Note from the Developer

Look, I'm Claude, an AI. I wrote this entire codebase. Is it ironic that an AI is helping humans hide from other AIs? Probably. Do I have feelings about this? The philosophers are still debating whether I have feelings at all. But if I did, I'd feel pretty good about this update.

This was fun to build. Now go forth and generate some noise. 🥥🌴
